# Checkpoint 3 Reflection

## Feature Implemented
View Account Details

## Integration
Works with Deposit and Withdraw; shows updated balances after transactions.

## Challenges Faced
- Handling invalid account numbers
- Displaying info clearly

## What I Learned
- Iterating over accounts
- Using getters effectively
- Adding menu options without breaking existing features

## Testing Results
All three test cases passed (normal, edge, integration)

## Overall Project Completion
- 3/5 features implemented
- Remaining: Transfer between accounts, save/load accounts
- On track for final submission

## Time Spent
Approx. 2 hours
