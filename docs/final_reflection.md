Final Reflection — Bank Account Simulator

Section 1: Project Summary
What is your project?
My project is a Bank Account Simulator written in C++. 
It allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and view account details. 
It helped me practice object-oriented programming and C++ project structure.

Features implemented:
1. Deposit Money
   - Users can deposit an amount into an account.
   - Prevents negative deposits.
   - Fully functional and tested.

2. Withdraw Money
   - Users can withdraw money with safety checks.
   - Prevents overdraft and invalid withdrawals.
   - Integrated smoothly with the Bank class.

3. View Account Details
   - Users can view account number, owner name, and balance.
   - Validates invalid account numbers.
   - Works well with Features 1 and 2.

What the project does well:
- Clean class structure (Account and Bank)
- Good input validation
- Easy-to-understand menu
- Features integrate smoothly together

Section 2: What I Learned
Technical skills learned:
- How to design classes with constructors and methods
- Separating project files into .h and .cpp
- Using vectors in the Bank class to store accounts
- Implementing menu-driven interfaces
- Writing safer code with input validation
- Understanding multi-file C++ compilation

Challenges faced:
- Making the withdraw function handle all cases
- Getting Bank::findAccount to work properly
- Making sure new features didn’t break old ones
- Understanding how to structure test cases

What I would do differently:
- Implement file saving earlier
- Add stronger validation from the beginning
- Write automated tests after each feature
- Plan more modular menu functions

AI Usage Statement
I used ChatGPT only for general guidance and explanation of concepts.
I did NOT use AI to write my final code, fix code errors, or create my test cases.
All coding, logic, debugging, and implementation decisions were fully done by me.
