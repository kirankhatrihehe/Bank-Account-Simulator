# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
I implemented the **Create Account** feature for the Bank Account Simulator. Users can now enter their account name and initial balance, and the program adds the account to the bank system.

## Challenges I Faced
- Figuring out how to store multiple accounts efficiently
- Handling user input properly (e.g., clearing `std::cin` before reading strings)
- Deciding on the best way to structure the Bank and BankAccount classes

## What I Learned
- How to design and implement C++ classes with constructors, getters, and setters
- How to manage multiple objects using a manager class (`Bank`)
- Importance of clearcommand and user prompts

## Time Spent
Approximately 3- 4 hours
